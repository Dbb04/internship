                <h2>About Bhagat Singh</h2>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was a charismatic Indian revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.</p>
                <p>He was born in a Sikh family in Punjab, British India, in 1907. His family had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p>
                <p>He was deeply influenced by the freedom fighters of his time and joined the Hindustan Republican Association, which was later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.</p>
                <p>Bhagat Singh is remembered as Shaheed (Martyr) Bhagat Singh, and his legacy continues to inspire many in India and around the world.</p>
